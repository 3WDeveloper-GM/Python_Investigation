# Power Quality Event Detection Using the Stockwell Transform

![Alt Text](https://github.com/3WDeveloper-GM/Python_Investigation/blob/main/stock.png)


Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor's capstone project conducted at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Honduras. This project addresses the critical task of identifying Power Quality Events (PQE) in the power system network. Power Quality Events encompass a wide range of deviations within the power network, including sag, high-frequency harmonics, high-frequency transients, and noise from various connected elements. The objective of this project was to develop a robust solution for detecting these events.

## Project Overview

### Stockwell Transform Approach

To tackle the complexity of identifying PQE, I employed the Stockwell Transform. This mathematical tool served as the foundation for extracting meaningful features from signal data. By utilizing the Stockwell Transform, I aimed to represent the diverse deviations commonly encountered in the power system network in a more accessible format.

### Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main components:

1. **Signal Deviation Modeling Library:** This library contains Python modules that model the different types of signal deviations encountered in power networks. Each deviation type, including sag, high-frequency harmonics, high-frequency transients, and noise, is represented using mathematical models.

2. **Feature Extraction Visualization Module:** The feature extraction process is crucial to understanding PQE. This module provides tools and visualizations to help you explore the raw feature extraction process, aiding in the comprehension of the Stockwell Transform's effectiveness.

3. **Real-Life Data:** I've included real-life power system data that I gathered during the project. This dataset can serve as a valuable resource for testing and experimentation.
